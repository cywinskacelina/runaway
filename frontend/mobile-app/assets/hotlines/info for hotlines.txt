1) Follow the same convetion for adding a new hotline as the others.
2) All the info outlined has to be filled. if the new hotline being added doesn't suport one of the methods, just leave it as null so it doesnt get rendered.
3) Make sure to add in the first text that a texting chat would need so the user knows what to text first. If this is not needed, just leave it as "" so the first text is empty.
