1) Follow the same convention for adding a new hotline as the others.
2) All the info outlined has to be filled. If the new hotline being added doesn't support one of the methods, just leave it as null, so it isn't rendered.
3) Make sure to add in the first text that a texting chat would need, so the user knows what to text first. If this is not required, leave it as "" (empty string, so the first text is blank).
