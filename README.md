Runaway is a mobile application where people can chat privately with trained volunteers for mental support/peer.
Currently, the repo is divided into three parts: Mobile app/ Web app/ Backend.



## Set Up

Install all npm packages before running the application

```bash
npm install
```
## Starting

```bash
node server.js
```

or for more convenience (automatically restarting the server upon file change),

```bash
nodemon server.js
```
### Frontend - Web, Mobile App
